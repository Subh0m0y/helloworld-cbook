# Hello, World!
This repository contains the first program that appears in my book. It is a simple Hello World program in C.

The reason I write this is out of tradition. If the reader manages to follow the instructions properly, write the code and successfully execute their first program, it will provide a boost of confidence to them and initiate them on a eventful journey of learning coding.
